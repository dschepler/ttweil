# Topos Theory with Early Internal Language

It seems that in most existing introductory texts on topos theory, the
subject of the internal language and the internal logic of a topos is
left until late in the text, or else omitted entirely.  However, in my
opinion, the internal logic is useful much earlier in the subject, and
without it, the proofs of basic properties of a topos become more
difficult to understand than necessary.  The purpose of this article
is to provide an expository overview of topos theory introducing the
internal language as early as possible, though in a relative informal
manner, and using it as appropriate in the basic proofs and
constructions.
